Step 1: Start
Step 2: Use recursion
Step 3: Let x, n be the two numbers where x is the base value and n is the exponent of x.
Step 4: Input x and n.
Step 5: If n is even, return 2 * power(x, y/2)
Step 6: If n is odd, return x * 2 * power(x, y/2)
Step 7: Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until n is equal to 0
Step 8: Output the final value which will be our final answer. 
Step 9: Finish
